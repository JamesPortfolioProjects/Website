        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Water Quality Tester â€” Full Technical Report</h1>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The Water Quality Tester is a real-time IoT device designed to monitor tap water safety and provide users with immediate insights into contamination levels. Developed as part of a Louisiana Tech University engineering course and competition, this project aimed to address community concerns over water safety, particularly in areas where city filtration systems may fall short.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Measure water quality in real time using accessible sensors.</li>
            <li>Create a cost-effective, compact, and user-friendly design.</li>
            <li>Display water safety data on an integrated LCD in understandable terms.</li>
            <li>Maintain sufficient water flow and pressure for practical use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Design & Planning</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The team selected a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor for its affordability and baseline reliability within project constraints. The mechanical design involved:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Integration of the sensor into a water flow housing connected to standard faucets.</li>
            <li>Accommodating the Arduino microcontroller, wiring, LCD display, and power supply.</li>
            <li>Designing custom faucet adapters and an enclosure in SolidWorks for 3D printing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Technical Implementation</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Arduino Uno to control sensor input and display output.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor:</strong> TDS sensor to monitor water quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Display:</strong> LCD programmed to show continuous real-time safety indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> Water-resistant casing designed with pressure management in mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Software:</strong> Custom Arduino script to filter readings, compare them with safety benchmarks, and translate results into clear warnings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Challenges</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Staying within a limited student budget while achieving reliable readings.</li>
            <li><strong>Size & Pressure:</strong> Keeping components small and ensuring proper water flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Translation:</strong> Turning raw TDS values into actionable safety indicators understandable by everyday users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. Testing & Validation</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Tested on tap water, filtered water, and artificially contaminated samples. The device accurately detected relative contamination differences and visually warned users when thresholds were exceeded.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Incorporating multi-parameter sensors (pH, turbidity, and heavy metals).</li>
            <li>Further miniaturization and professional-grade water resistance.</li>
            <li>Long-term durability testing and battery optimization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">8. Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project pushed us to bridge hardware design and software logic under real-world constraints. We delivered a fully functional, consumer-facing prototype validated by testing. With more resources, I would optimize both hardware and the data display system for commercialization and real consumer use.</p>
